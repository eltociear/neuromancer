# Differentiable Parametric Programming in Neuromancer

Constrained optimization problems where the solution x depends on the varying problem parameters ξ are
called parametric programming problems. Differentiable Parametric Programming (DPP) is a set of methods
that use automatic differentiation (AD) to compute sensitivities of constrained optimization problems w.r.t.
to the problem parameters for obtaining parametric solutions of the problem

Recent years have seen a rich literature
of deep learning (DL) models for solving the constrained optimization problems on real-world tasks such
as power grid, traffic, or wireless system optimization. Earlier attempts simply adopt imitation learning
(i.e., supervised learning) to train function approximators via a minimization of the prediction error using
labeled data of pre-computed solutions using iterative solvers (i.e. IPOPT). Unfortunately, these models can
hardly perform well on unseen data as the outputs are not trained to satisfy physical constraints, leading to
infeasible solutions.
To address the feasibility issues, existing methods have been imposing constraints on the output space
of deep learning models for a subsequent differentiation using AD tools. These differentiable programming-
based methods, also called end-to-end learning, directly consider the original objectives and constraints in
the DL training process without the need of expert labeled data. 
The following figure conceptually demonstrated the difference between supervised imitation learning 
and unsupervised Differentiable Parametric Programming (DPP) which solution is obtained by 
differentiating the objectives and constraints of the parametric optimization  problem.

## DPP Problem Formulation
A generic formulation of the DPP is given
in the form of a parametric constrained optimization problem:

*DPP problem formulation.*


## Differentiable Loss Functions of Parametric Constrained Optimization Problems

There are several ways in which we can enforce the constraints satisfaction
while learning the solution π_Θ(ξ) of the differentiable constrained optimization problem (1). 
The simplest approach is to penalize the constraints violations by augmenting 
the loss function L (1a) with the penalty functions given as:
![DPP_penalty_loss.](/examples/parametric_programming/figs/DPP_penalty_loss.PNG)  
*DPP penalty loss function.*

Other approaches include barrier functions, or Augmented Lagrangian type methods.

## DPP Problem Solution

The main advantage of having a differentiable objective function and constraints
in the DPP problem formulation (1) is that it allows us to use automatic differentiation to directly compute
the gradients of the parametric solution map π_Θ(ξ). In particular, by representing the problem (1) as a
computational graph and leveraging the chain rule, we can directly compute the gradients of the loss function
L w.r.t. the solution map weights Θ as follows:

## DPP Optimization Algorithm
The gradient-based solution of the DPP problem is summarized in the following Algorithm:
